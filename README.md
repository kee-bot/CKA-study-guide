# CKA-study-guide-
A quick read on the materials i used to study for CKA-Certified Kubernetes Administrator + random tips. 

###### A quick intro:
I passed my CKA in December 2024 with a score of 89/100, being a mostly paranoid person i decided to take a look at almost every study guide tips and tricks which was on the internet. 
Was it necessary? No.
I hope to compile all the neccessary information you would need to pass CKA. 

###### CKA: 
1. The test consists of around 17 questions, out of which a majority are similar to well known study guides and resources.
2. The two FREE killercoda mock exams given along with CKA registration are harder than the real exam, but do note the main difficulty with killercoda i faced was finishing on time, it was almost impossible for me to finish all the questions on time. While the complexity level of the questions are similar to CKA.
3. Another challenge and what makes killercoda important to attempt is to get used to the interface especially if you aren't a linux user. The interface does tend to lag and it only occupies a section of a monitor, so it makes your workspace really small especially if your display is less than 13 inches. SO ensure to get familar with it cause you cannot waste time on it during your main exam.
4. Finally, the goal should not be to just pass the test but to gain practical experience with kubernetes.

NOTE: Some mac users tend to change their key bindings so cmd matches ctrl so it is easier to copy paste, for me my custom keybindings did not work in the exam so i had to use the default. This is another reason why killercoda is important. 
Ctrl+shift+c/v to copy paste as linux does not have command. 

#### CKA Study Materials [FREE]

#### CKA Study Materials [PAID]

If you are willing to shell out some cash you could do the udemy course, Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) with Practice Tests by Mumshad Mannambeth is really great, covers the entire syllabus and also comes with free kodekloud practice sessions which are really helpful. Do note that the kodekloud practice sessions would be slightly easier than the real exam, plus the UI of kodekloud is really convinient unlike the linux virtual machine given in the exam.
